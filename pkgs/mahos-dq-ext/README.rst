############
mahos-dq-ext
############

This package contains C++ extensions for mahos-dq based on pybind11 library.
Users don't have to care about build methods because it's built by setuptools on ``pip install``.

Development
===========

We assume Linux or compatible environment (properly installed gcc and pybind11) for development.
``make`` can be used to compile the extension.

setup.py
--------

When a new module is added, update ``setup.py`` which defines the correspondence between 
Python module and C++ source code.

clangd
------

If you use ``clangd`` language server for C++ development,
``compile_commands.json`` can be generated by ``compiledb make clang``.

``compiledb`` can be installed by ``pip install compiledb``.
